Introduction:-
The main aim of the wipers in all the vechiles is to clean the front and back windsheeld.
An automobile wiper system is an arm and motor based system which is used to clean the mirrors in case of rains , water , cleaning liquids etc. this system can be used not only for wind shield even for the rear mirror as well. A wiper is a metal blade, which on one end it is connected to a motor and on the other end is attached with a rubber strip, which helps in cleaning the mirrors, and in case of no usage, it helps the blades stick to the mirror. Windscreen washer system is a system which comprises of wipers and water nozzle system. These water nozzles sprays water on the mirrors which helps in cleaning windshields. These systems are installed not only in front side but as well in rear wind shields as well. These helps in cleaning mirrors from dust, melting ice and in many other ways which helps the drivers to drive a vehicle in seamless way. This system works in a manual way which driver have controllers in their hand but now days as the technology getting advanced this system has become autonomous based on sensors. I explain about how wiper works based on stm32, an ARM based Microcontroller.
