# INTRODUCTION

Wiper system is an important component in all the vehicle system. They consist of
ac motor fitted with arm which cleans the windshield surface of both front and rear
windshield. Modern day cars also poses automatic sensing operation using Rain
sensor which basically consists of LED that detects the amount of water on the
windshield.
Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched
ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of
safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed
to an ever increasing number of distractions, rain-sensing wiper systems become an
even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take
his/her hands off the wheel. Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as
variable speed operation. The traditional wiper system however requires driver
constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed
constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed. Because the manual
adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause
accident wiper automatically cording to the amount of water on the windshield and
in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining. The
majority of motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, locomotives, watercraft
with enclosed cabins, and some aircraft, are fitted with one or more such wipers,
which are usually legal requirements. Wiper system improve visibility of driving and
can be considered as an integral part of the vehicle safety system.

# OBJECTIVES

The design and implementation is divided into different objectives and
outcomes. Below are the list of objectives-

• To move wiper when ignition starts

• To move wiper to clean the windshield

# CONCLUSION

When the wiper switch is in the off position, the wiper will not function. When the
wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. Accordingly,
when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high
speed.
This is how the car wiper works, along with its components and detail functions, you
should take care of it as well as possible and be diligent in cleaning it.
